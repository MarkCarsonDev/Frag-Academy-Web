            <p>Playing competitive Team
                Fortress 2 can be a very
                rewarding experience. When playing competitively, you improve drastically at the game, meet new friends,
                and learn
                things you would never have learned if you hadn't tried.
                <br><br>TF2 is also very unique in that its skill cap is incredibly high, so once you start, you can
                continue to
                improve at the game for years before becoming bored.
                <br><br>Whether you start playing competitively because you were looking for a game to get better at,
                because you
                wanted to play with your friends, or because you wanted to be good enough to crush your friends, TF2 and
                its
                competitive community will continue to suffice your competitive needs. With a cooperative community,
                tons
                upon
                <strong>tons</strong> of helpful resources, and many, many more things, you're sure to have an enjoyable
                time.<br></p>

            <p>Of course not! It's not like
                you'll be playing against the world's best players as soon as you start! As stated in the previous
                paragraph, there
                are many resources to help newer players get into competitive TF2 ranging from information sites, to PUG
                (pick-up
                game) groups, to helpful YouTube channels and series.

                <br><br>Competitive doesn't mean that everyone is good, it
                just means
                that everyone is trying to win. As long as you try hard to win or improve, you're a competitive player!

            <p class="center bridge">Now that you're convinced, you're probably looking for ways to get involved in the
                competitive scene. Luckily enough, we do more than convince people to play it!<br><br>If you already
                have a
                group of friends you'd like to play on a team with, great work! If not, that's fine too, as you'll get
                to
                make more friends! <br><br></p>
