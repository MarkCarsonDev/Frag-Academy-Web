    - [b][i]What is this?[/i][/b]
    This is a group for a competitive TF2 cup. Basically, its a small tournament put on by the community. This cup is for the 6v6 format and intends to bring newer players to the competitive scene.
    
    - [b][i]For which skill levels?[/i][/b]
    At most, non-playoff UGC Steel, non-playoff ETF2L Open, and/or non-playoff OZFortress Open experience.
    
    -[b][i]What can I do if I'm above those skill levels?[/i][/b]
    The teams will need mentors, so if you are skilled enough and want to mentor a team, the just talk to a Staff member and they'll find you a team to mentor. If you aren't good enough to mentor but you're too good to compete, we're still accepting new staff. Send a message to our admins on [url=https://discord.gg/WQfTw6V]our Discord[/url] to apply for Staff and to help out.
