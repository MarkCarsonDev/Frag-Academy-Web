            <p>This is a page for a competitive TF2 cup. Basically, its a tournament put on by the community.
                This cup is for the 6v6 format and meant for newer players to the competitive scene.<br><br>
                Players will be expected to be newer competitive players though. At most, UGC Steel/non-playoff ETF2l
                Open/non-playoff OZFortress Open experience.<br><br>This cup intends to bring more interest to the
                competitive TF2 scene and

            <p>Playing competitive Team
                Fortress 2 can be a very
                rewarding experience. When playing competitively, you improve drastically at the game, meet new friends,
                and learn
                things you would never have learned if you hadn't tried.
                <br><br>Whether you start playing competitively because you're looking for a game to get better at,
                because you
                wanted to play with your friends, or because you wanted to be good enough to crush your friends, playing
                competitive TF2 is super fun.<br><br>
                This cup will not only show you what competitive is like, but there will also be mentors available to
                each team to help learn map callouts, positioning, and strategies.<br></p>

            <p>Players within the skill ranges of "just got interested in the game" and "have tried competitive before"
                are allowed. It is recommended that you at least understand basic game functions and class roles before
                participating though. Players will be checked by our staff to ensure that they aren't too skilled for
                this cup (just to keep it fair).
